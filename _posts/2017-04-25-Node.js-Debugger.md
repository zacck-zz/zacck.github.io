**Debugger??**

The `debugger` in Node.js, What's that? Why should I bother?

Well...

This is a built-in debugging utility for `Node.js`. Debugging as we know is the process of finding and resolving defects in your code! This is a major part of building any kind of software.


To use this utility one needs to start their program with the `debug` option.

`node debug myfil.js`

This will run the file in debug mode and will be watching for certain triggers, let's try out a few to see how this utility works!

Consider having to build a function that adds something to a number then multiplies it before returning a value.

```javascript
//myfile.js
//get some variables

var initialAmount =  20
debugger;
var multiplied = initialAmount * 5 ;
debugger;
var result  =  multiplied + 5;
```

What is happening here?

Ignoring the  `debugger;`  lines this script just multiples a function by `5` and then adds `5` to that result.

Now that that's clear when we are debugging this script we would run it as such

`node debug myfile.js`

This would give us a result akin to the following one.

![node debug myfile.js](/images/run-debugger.png)

As you can see here my application has started then stopped at the first instance of `debugger` this is called a [breakpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint).

Using the `s` option we can step to the next  line of code, we do this by typing `s` while in debug mode see below:

![node debug s](/images/s-debug.png)

You can also use the `o` option to step out of a function by executing the rest of the lines of the function the debugger is currently stopped in.

**REPL**

We can put the debugger in `repl` mode and this will enable us to check the values of our variables in the context of the current breakpoint. Use this when performing complex logic and you would like to walk through your code as it does the calculations.

let's try it by typing `repl` as our debugger is running.

`debug> repl`

Once this is done we can access the values of our variables by typing their name, While here we can set the value of the variable too!

I find that repl mode doesn't capture values as you expect them experiment them and let me know your results.

How do you use the debugger?
